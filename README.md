SES Deliverability Dashboard
============================
This module will create a [Deliverability Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/bouncecomplaintdashboard.html) that shows information about SES Email bounces and complaints.

It is a slight adaptation of the functionality described in the AWS Developer documentation because it uses an SNS Email topic to send the report, rather then sending it directly from a verified SES sender.  This elimates manual steps.

Usage
-----
```hcl
resource "aws_ses_domain_identity" "example" {
  domain = "example.com"
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "example_amazonses_verification_record" {
  zone_id = "ABCDEFGHIJ123"
  name    = "_amazonses.example.com"
  type    = "TXT"
  ttl     = "600"
  records = ["${aws_ses_domain_identity.example.verification_token}"]
}

module "dashboard" {
  source                     = "connect-group/ses-dashboard/aws"
  to_addresses               = ["someone@example.com", "someone.else@example.com"]
  email_from_display_name    = "Bounced Emails Dashboard"
  email_introduction_message = "Bounced emails, or complaint emails, have been received for this account."
}

resource "aws_ses_identity_notification_topic" "bounce_notifications" {
  topic_arn         = "${module.dashboard.topic_arn}"
  notification_type = "Bounce"
  identity          = "${aws_ses_domain_identity.example.domain}"
}

resource "aws_ses_identity_notification_topic" "bounce_notifications" {
  topic_arn         = "${module.dashboard.topic_arn}"
  notification_type = "Complaint"
  identity          = "${aws_ses_domain_identity.example.domain}"
}
```

Manual Steps
------------
AWS will send a subscription email to the email specified by `to_addr`.

In order to capture bounce and complaint notifications, the verified email sender (email identity, or domain identity) which sends emails must be configured to notify the application of bounces.  

Email Identities cannot be created by Terraform or CloudFormation, but domain identities can be created (as in the example above).

If your email identity is managed manually then you will need to  configure SES notificatins as described in [Part 5](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/dashboardconfigureSESnotifications.html) of the AWS tutorial.

1. Open the Amazon SES console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/.

2. In the navigation bar, under Identity Management, choose Email Addresses.

3. Select the email address that you want to use to receive bounce and complaint notifications, 
   and then choose View Details.

4. Under Notifications, choose Edit Configuration.

5. For both Bounces and Complaints, choose the Amazon SNS topic 'email-delivery-topic'

6. Repeat steps 3â€“5 for each email address that should receive bounce or complaint notifications.


> **Note**
>
> Unlike the example AWS Dashboard - *there is no need to purge the SQS queue*.  
> This version of the lambda will ignore items in the queue that it cannot parse.

Restrictions
------------
This module expects the SQS and SNS topic to be in the same region.  

Testing
-------
To test the Lambda function,

1. Open the Amazon SES console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/.

2. In the column on the left, choose either Email Addresses or Domains.

3. Select a verified email address or domain, and then choose Send a Test Email.

4. For To:, type bounce@simulator.amazonses.com. For Subject and Body, type some sample text. Choose Send Test Email.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to create another test message, but this time, for To:, type complaint@simulator.amazonses.com.

6. Open the Amazon SQS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/. The Messages Available column should indicate that 2 messages are available.

7. Open the Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.

8. In the navigation bar, choose Functions.

9. In the list of functions, choose the function you created in Part 6: Create an AWS Lambda Function.

10. Choose Test. When the function finishes running, expand the Details section. If the Lambda function was configured properly, you will receive one of the following messages:

> null: Indicates that the function ran without errors.
> Queue empty: Indicates that there were no new bounce or complaint notifications in the queue.
